# LLM orchestrator for robotic systems
This repo contains prototype code for a language-driven robotic task execution architecture. The idea is to solve tasks by relying on an LLM's "common sense". The planner outputs a plan, which is then carried out step by step through motion primitives.

This repo has moved! Please visit https://github.com/EGarrabe/Language-driven-robotics for the code and impkementation guidelines.
